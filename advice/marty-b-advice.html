                <h4>Practice patience and persistence.</h4>

                <p>The progress of learning to design web pages comes in waves. Some aspects show quick visual changes, while others can be more technical and time consuming but neccessary concepts to learn. It is easy to feel overwhelmed when learning new processes in web design because of such intense attention you must pay to the details. Pretty soon, with a little patience and persistence you will gain an understanding of the basic concepts and then forge ahead to gain an understanding of the more focused bits of information.</p>


                <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
                <p>Personally, I don't like to ask questions to the instructors until I have exausted all my other search venues. This helps in the long run by teaching me how to find solutions on my own. However, this can be more time consuming. For example, I did not run into too many intense problems with learning html but css was another story. The box in a box in a box theory to me was like learning to play chess in 3D. Trying to position one thing will misplace 3 others! What was most helpful for me in this situation was to experiment by changing the numbers and watching the results until I started to get a clear understanding of what was controlling what.</p>

                <p>My next major road block was getting my files, and dreamhost, and filezilla to work. I put my initial web page onto my new domain, but then decided to make a new improved web page.  As I tried to get rid of the old and replace it with the new I got completely confused. I could not make it work. When I finally asked for help through dreamhost, I was given wrong information that I spent several days working with and I felt completely lost! I was really about to give up on the whole idea that I could be successful in web design. But then, I got the information that I needed from dreamhost. They did not answer my problem. But they gave me the information that I needed to figure it out and I was able to load my new web site! By going through this process, I got a much clearer picture of how to employ these new skills and how to adjust my expectations for resolving difficult challenges.</p>
                <p>That feeling of being overwhelmed is a sign that your brain is being conditioned to grow in new ways. Working through those feelings with patience and persistence will lead to understanding and personal growth. Soon, with practice, you can be a problem solving guru!</p>
